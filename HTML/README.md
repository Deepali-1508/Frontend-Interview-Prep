# Frequently Asked HTML Questions 

## 1. What is HTML?

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It provides a structure for content on the web, using a system of tags to define different elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images.

## 2. What are Tags, Elements, and Attributes?

In HTML, the terms "tags," "elements," and "attributes" are fundamental concepts:

- **Tags:** Tags are the building blocks of HTML. They define the structure and hierarchy of content on a web page. Tags are represented by opening (`<tag>`) and closing (`</tag>`) elements, surrounding the content they affect.

- **Elements:** An element is a complete set of tags, along with the content they enclose. It consists of the opening tag, the content, and the closing tag. For example, in `<p>This is a paragraph.</p>`, `<p>` is the opening tag, `This is a paragraph.` is the content, and `</p>` is the closing tag.

- **Attributes:** Attributes are used along with the HTML tags to define the characteristics of the element. Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are always included in the opening tag and are used to modify the behavior or appearance of the element. Attributes consist of a name and a value, separated by an equal sign. For example, in `<a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>`, `href` is the attribute name, and `https://example.com` is the attribute value.

- **Void Elements:** HTML elements which do not have closing tags or do not need to be closed are Void elements. For Example <br />, <img />, <hr />, etc.
Understanding these concepts is crucial for creating well-structured and semantically meaningful HTML documents.

## 3. What are HTML entities?

# HTML Entities

HTML entities are special codes used to represent reserved characters, as well as characters that might not easily be typed or displayed using the standard keyboard. These entities are particularly useful in HTML documents where certain characters have special meanings, such as `<` and `>` in tags or characters with reserved meanings like `&`.

HTML entities are written as a combination of the `&` (ampersand) symbol, followed by a specific code, and ending with a semicolon (`;`). Here are some common HTML entities:

**Character Entity References:**

- `&lt;`: Represents the less-than symbol `<`.
- `&gt;`: Represents the greater-than symbol `>`.
- `&amp;`: Represents the ampersand symbol `&`.
- `&quot;`: Represents the double quotation mark `"`.

For apostrophe or single quotation mark, you can use either `&apos;` or the actual character `'`.

## 4. What is Class and ID in HTML, and What's the Difference?

In HTML, both class and ID are attributes used to apply styles or scripts to specific elements.

- **class:**
- A class is a way to apply a style or script to multiple elements on a page.
- Multiple elements can share the same class.
- Defined using the class attribute: <div class="example">.
- Styled in CSS with a period: .example { /* styles */ }.

- **id:**
  - An ID is used to uniquely identify a single element on a page.
  - Each ID must be unique within a page.
  - Defined using the id attribute: <div id="uniqueElement">.
  - Styled in CSS with a hash: #uniqueElement { /* styles */ }.
  
 
- **Difference:** 

  Classes are for multiple elements; IDs are for a single, unique element.
  Multiple elements can share the same class, but each ID must be unique.
  CSS rules for classes start with a period (.), and for IDs, they start with a hash (#).

## 5. What are Tables in HTML and Types of Tables?

In HTML, tables are used to organize and display data in a structured format. A table is created using the `<table>` element, and it consists of rows and columns. The basic structure includes `<tr>` for table rows, `<th>` for table headers, and `<td>` for table data.

### Types of Tables:

1. **Ordered Lists (<ol>):** An ordered list is used to represent a list of items in a specific sequence or order. Each item in the list is marked with a number or another ordered marker. In HTML, you create an ordered list using the <ol> element and list items with the <li> element.
 ```html
<ol>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
</ol>
```

2. **Unordered Lists (<ul>):** An unordered list is used to represent a list of items without a specific order or sequence. Each item in the list is typically marked with a bullet point or another unordered marker. In HTML, you create an unordered list using the <ul> element and list items with the <li> element.
  ```html
 <ul>
  <li>Apple</li>
  <li>Banana</li>
  <li>Orange</li>
</ul>
```

 3. **Description Lists (<dl>):** A description list is used to represent a list of terms and their corresponding descriptions. Each term is defined using the <dt> (definition term) element, and its description is provided using the <dd> (definition description) element.
  ```html
<dl>
  <dt>HTML</dt>
  <dd>HyperText Markup Language</dd>

  <dt>CSS</dt>
  <dd>Cascading Style Sheets</dd>

  <dt>JavaScript</dt>
  <dd>A programming language for the web</dd>
</dl>
```
